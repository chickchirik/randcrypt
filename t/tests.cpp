    Created by <chickchirik> on 08/10/2019.

    DESCRIPTION:
    tests sub-project based on Catch2 testing
    framework that runs tests on core modules.
    In order to run tests - just build this
    project and execute t.
    In order to add tests - create new cpp
    file, include Catch2 and fill it with
    tests. Then add it as executable to
    this project's CMakeLists.
    Do NOT change this (tests.cpp) file,
    because it will lead to recompilation
    of entire Catch2 framework.
